# About the project
This is a chess game that is made using WPF, with XAML for the frontend of the project and C# in the backend. I want the game to be able to be played in two player mode as well as single player.
## Why I did this project
I did this to prove my proficiency and compitency as a C# and .NET developer. This project displays my ability to make use of Object Oriented Programming as well as basic C# concepts such as loops and if statements. It also displays that I am able to work on the backend, as well as the frontend and connect the backend with the frontend. It also displays my abilities as a .NET developer in the form of the project being done in WPF.
## Future plans for this project
I want the machine play against the player by utilizing algorithms, which would display my knowledge in the field of computer science. Unfortunately I still have to finish the base project, which is just making a functioning, polished chess game. At the moment the program is meant to be 2 player, but it is still riddled with bugs that still have to be sorted out by me.
## Why am I still making this project available for anyone to view if it does not even function properly yet?
I think that even though the project is buggy and not functioning yet, I still believe that anyone who views this project would agree that it still proves my ability to program in C#.
